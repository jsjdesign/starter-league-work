	      	I have a lot of hobbies, sometimes an overwhelming amount. I like people watching. I am interested in helping create intelligible, enjoyable products and engaging experiences. I learned more about people working as a grocery store check-out girl than almost anywhere else. I believe surrounding yourself with people who have different backgrounds,ideas, and expectations is one of the most valuable things anyone can do.
